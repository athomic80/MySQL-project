# 💻 MySQL Database Analysis Project 🧮

Welcome to my MySQL Database Analysis Project! 🎉 This repository showcases a series of SQL queries that analyze real-world data using relational databases. The project covers essential concepts like database relationships, normalization, and performing data extraction using SQL queries. It's a great example of my SQL skills and data analysis journey! 🚀

## 📚 **Project Overview**

### **🔍 Key Concepts**
1. **Types of Relationships in Relational Databases** 🔗:
   - **One-to-One**: A record in one table links to just one record in another table.  
     _Example_: A person has only one passport, and a passport belongs to one person. 🛂
   - **One-to-Many**: A record in one table links to multiple records in another table.  
     _Example_: A customer can place many orders, but an order belongs to only one customer. 🛍️
   - **Many-to-Many**: Records in two tables are linked to multiple records in each.  
     _Example_: A student can enroll in many courses, and a course can have many students. 📚 (Requires a bridge table)

2. **Normalization** 🔧:
   - The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity. It's like tidying up your database to make sure everything is neat and efficient. 🧹

## 🧑‍💻 **SQL Queries in Action**

### **✨ Sample Queries**
- **Task 1**: Understanding relationships between tables, like One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many. 🤝
- **Task 2**: Normalizing data to ensure the database is clean, consistent, and error-free. 🧼
- **Task 3 - Task 5**: SQL queries to uncover data, like counting the cities in the USA 🇺🇸, finding Argentina's population and life expectancy 🇦🇷, and identifying the country with the highest life expectancy 🌍.
- **Task 6 - Task 10**: Playing with city data! Sorting, filtering, and finding cities based on specific criteria (e.g., population size or city names starting with "F" or "Be"). 🌆
- **Task 11 - Task 15**: Digging deeper into city and country data, like discovering the most populated cities 🏙️ or learning which continent has the highest population. 🌎

## 📦 **Project Setup** 🛠️

### **⚙️ Prerequisites**
- **MySQL Database**: You’ll need MySQL set up and running to execute the queries.
- **Database Schema**: This project requires you have access to the 'World' database with `city`, `country`, and `countrylanguage` tables. 🌐

### **🚀 How to Run**
1. Clone or download the SQL queries from this repository. 📥
2. Set up the MySQL database with the required tables. 🔧
3. Run the SQL queries to uncover valuable insights and get some data magic going! 🧙‍♂️
